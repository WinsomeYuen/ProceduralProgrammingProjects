## Music Quiz
This is a short 3 question quiz that can be easily extended by adding more questions. It
asks for the team name so if player wants to quit early they can carry on with the quiz later.
It also allows you to have as many players you want on your team. On each round it will ask
all the players the question and then print if they have got it correct. At the end of the
round it will print out all the players current scores. 

You can save your work at the end of each question, excluding the final question. At the
end of the whole quiz a table is printed in the order of which questions most people got 
the most correct to least.

I have included a test file called "cool.txt" which has 3 players on the team.

## Dinosaur Pet
The program allows you to look after multiple dinosaurs. The program will allow you to fill
out the name for each dinosaur and randomly generate a species for each one. It will also
randomly generate the current status for the dinosaur. Although the program will make sure
you never start with high hunger/thirst so the game doesn't end before you play it.

## Olympic Medal table
The olympic medal table allows you to fill in the daily medals won by each country, you 
have the option of 4 different countries - Japan, Canada, Germany and the UK. For all of
them the first day has already been filled out, so you automatically start filling out 
the 2nd day. However before filling it out, you will be shown the medal table from the
previous day. After filling out the daily medals you have the option of viewing the 
individual medal scores so far or all the medal.

Then another menu option will pop-up where you have the option to view medals from the 
previous days. Within the option you can view a single day or the medals for each day
as a list. The other menu options include allowing you to continue filling out the
medal table for the next day, exit the whole program, pick another country to fill in 
the current medal or save data in a file for that country.

If you are still on the program and chose to fill out another country your data will
still be there as long as the program is not closed. You will need to save it if you
want your data to still be there next time you open your program. Each country is saved
in it's own individual file. So after you have picked your country you want to start
filling in the medal table for you will be asked if you want to load a saved file.

Test file included is called "japan.txt".
